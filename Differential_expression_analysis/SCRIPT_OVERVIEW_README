The four Rexecute files correspond to the four different settings for running sleuth
Rexecute_nonaggregated =Transcript mode standard filter 
Rexecute_nonaggregated_filtered=Transcript mode custom filter
Rexecute_gene=Gene mode standard filter
Rexecute_gene_filtere=Gene mode custom filter

transcriptPlotPrep and extractlogchange (the former calls the latter) handle the extraction and bundling of the data needed for the volcano plot

genelist_cleanup adresses partially duplicate lines in the output of the gene mode analyses
(Multiple for the same StringTie gene-IDs if they have multiple reference-genes assigned to them --> collapsed into one line per StrinTie gene-ID)
